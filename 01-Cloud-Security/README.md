## Cloud Security

This section documents my learning on securing cloud environments.

Topics include:
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Logging and monitoring
- Network security concepts
- Data protection and encryption
- Secure configuration principles
- Cloud Architecture
- Use of Terraform

Notes are written from a security and governance perspective. I intend to update this repository on a weekly basis.
